# Restaurant_management_system

##### - Introduction:

Aim of the project is to create a web application with the user interface to view and order the food items. This helps the restaurant management team by improving their business with the online orders. The food items are displayed in the application based on the availability. This application also helps restaurant workers in reducing the manual work like noting down every order through phone call or by any other medium.

This web application has the ability to maintain a session of the user and creates one to one relationship with the Cart table(cart products) and maintains a record in the table with the products added into the cart. Admin can login and edit/add the products as per the availability. The application is developed using Front end technologies HTML5, CSS3. Coming to Backend technologies we have used NodeJS and Database used is MongoDB connected using Object-Document Mapping Library mongoose The primary goal of creating this system is to diminish the repetitive manual work at Restaurant counters.
